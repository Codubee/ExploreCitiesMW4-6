<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was created by ___ during the Fall 2020 session of Codubee. We built this project as a safe way to get people out of their homes and visiting local cities.  Covid has made it difficult to travel by air, so this tool explores cities within driving distance of a given zip code.
